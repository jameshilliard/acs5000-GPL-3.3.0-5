        must observe the following. The Original code contains third party 
        software libraries copyrighted under their own licenses. 
        Redistribution of Libraries in source code, with or without 
        modification, or redistribution in binary form falls under the terms 
        of the licenses for the corresponding Libraries. The licenses are 
        included in the source distribution. Accordingly, You are granted no 
        other right to modify and/or redistribute the Libraries than already 
        provided for by the license of the Libraries as further specified in 
        the applicable license agreements which is set forth on Exhibit B. 
        Future releases or updates of Original Code may include additional 
        third party libraries not listed in Exhibit B in this agreement. 
        They will be clearly marked by Licensor as third party software, and 
        if they are used, their license agreements must be obeyed.

2.4     You expressly acknowledge and agree that although Licensor and each 
        Contributor grants the licenses to their respective portions of the 
        Covered Code set forth herein, no assurances are provided by 
        Licensor or any Contributor that the Covered Code does not infringe 
        the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other 
        entity. Licensor and each Contributor disclaim any liability to You 
        for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of 
        intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to 
        exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, You hereby 
        assume sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property 
        rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license 
        is required to allow You to distribute the Covered Code, it is Your 
        responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the 
        Covered Code.

3       Your Grants

        In consideration of, and as a condition to, the licenses granted to 
        You under this License:

        (a)     You hereby grant to Licensor and all third parties a 
                non-exclusive, royalty-free license, under Your Applicable 
                Patent Rights and other intellectual property rights (other 
                than patent) owned or controlled by You, to use, reproduce, 
                display, perform, modify, distribute and Deploy Your 
                Modifications of the same scope and extent as Licensor's 
                licenses under Sections 2.1 to 2.3; and

        (b)     You hereby grant to Licensor and its affiliates a 
                non-exclusive, world-wide, royalty-free, perpetual and 
                irrevocable license, under Your Applicable Patent Rights and 
                other intellectual property rights (other than patent) owned 
                or controlled by You, to use, reproduce, display, perform, 
                modify or have modified (for Licensor and/or its

                in any form, through multiple tiers of distribution.

        License are fulfilled for the Covered Code or any portion thereof.

5       Limitations on License

        permitted herein require additional commercial licenses, such as an 
        OEM license, from Licensor which Licensor may grant in its sole 
        discretion. Any attempt to otherwise copy, modify, sublicense or 
        distribute the Program or the Covered Code is void and will 
        terminate Your rights under this License as provided in Section 
        12.1.

6       Additional Terms

        You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,

        one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only 
        on Your own behalf and as Your sole responsibility, and not on 
        behalf of Licensor or any Contributor. You must obtain the 
        recipient's agreement that any such Additional Terms are offered by 
        You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold 
        Licensor and every Contributor harmless for any liability incurred 
        (including reasonable attorney�s fees) by or claims asserted against 
        Licensor or such Contributor by reason of any such Additional Terms.

        from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing 
        version number. Once Original Code has been published under a 
        particular version of this License, You may continue to use it under 
        the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Original 
        Code under the terms of any subsequent version of this License

        modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this 
        License.

        or distribute.

13.3    Waiver; Construction
